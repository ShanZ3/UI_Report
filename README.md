User Interview Report
============================

By Shan Zhong <br>
For 2019 Fall DH150 User Experience Design final project <br>

## The Main Design Challenge
> With the development of Internet medical and wearable medical devices, more and more people are willing to record and manage their own health data through their smartphones. The health app not only spreads a lot of health knowledge, but also provides a variety of services, including setting reminders, recording and analysis functions for medical device use, and online consultation for professional doctors. These services can solve the doubts encountered in life without leaving home, so its emergence is in line with the development of the times and market demand. The main design purpose and challenge for this project is to improve the user experience of the product in visual design and meet the user's demand for personalized, artistic and comfortable product design.

## Target users
> This user interview survey is targeted for iOS health app users who are frequently used the app to customize the health management plan, to seek medical registration, to consult the condition, to understand the health information, or to understand the main functions and processes of iOS health app, who can provide us with authentic and credible data.<br>

> The source of users for this user interview are: friends who have used the iOS health app nearby; searched the iOS health app wechat group, dig out active users, and determine the interview users after screening. <br>

> All interviewed users were conducted by means of directed invitations, which were carried out one-on-one through recording. In the interview process, the method of quick recording was used to record the interview content and form an interview report.

## Reflection
> I should have asked my interviewee which type of iOS devices they used before I sent out the inviation. There are some differences between different versions of iOS health app. The participant's mobile device is iOS 12 and the tested version is iOS 13. 
> I should have figure out more detailed questions for the participant to ask for their experience with the iOS type.
> Everything else went well
